# Community & Networking
I can't say this enough - get involved in the community and network with others!!

Even if you don't feel that you currently can contribute immediately, join some platforms and community groups to see what other people are talking about and make some friends.  You might be surprised at how similar you are to others in the space.

You might even join a space where you can ask people for help in solving a certain problem set.

Network, network, network!  I think most people can agree that knowing people helps.  I don't fully agree with the "it's not about what you know, it's about who you know" mentality.

In fact, I think it's much better to think "it's about how much you know and who you know, and who you know knows".  Humans like to talk about themselves and their work - many people also want to help others.  Asking for informational interviews and simply getting to know what other people do, what they like/dislike, opinions, and any advice for those in their field can be so helpful in developing your own goals.

Join community groups like your local DefCon (DC) group, Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), or Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).  Look in Meetups or EventBrite to find other techy events in your area.
