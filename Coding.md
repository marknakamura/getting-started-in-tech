# Coding
No one is saying that you need to be a developer.

**HOWEVER**

Having a general knowledge of coding is incredibly important.  It can help you automate certain tasks (that would manually take quite a bit of time), analyze things like malware, understand vulnerabilities and attack techniques, etc.

There are many coding languages.  A popular coding to start with is Python as it's known for being easier to learn.

As you continue to learn more, you'll find that many coding (and scripting) languages have the same concept, even though the syntax might be different.

Here's some resources to help you get started with coding.
