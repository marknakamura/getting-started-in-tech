# Documentation
I wish I had done a better job earlier on in my journey with this.

This might be the most challenging section in this series - writing down all the things you're learning, what challenges you faced, and how you overcame it.

Value proposal:
Create your own references for the time when you forget how you fixed a certain problem
Create a professional portfolio that showcases your journey and skills to others
Help others who might face the same problem set or be interested in learning the same thing

Here's some tools you can use to document things.
