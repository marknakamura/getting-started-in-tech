# Education
Continuing education / improvement / learning are things that are near and dear to me.

It's hard for me to even imagine a world where I stop learning things.

With that being said, let's talk education.

Some people are very focused on certifications or a degree or just labbing and getting experience.

Some people feel strongly on skills vs "paper qualifications" (certifications or degrees).

In my opinion, it doesn't matter as long you're learning something from whatever it is you're doing.  Of course, you're on this page to learn how to be technical and the majority of the resources are going to be hands-on-keyboard, technical things.

However, with that being said, there is nothing wrong with pursuing paper creds.  In fact, I think one of the least thought about benefits of certifications or degrees is that they provide a clear goal and a definitive ending.

If you were curious about certifications, check out this map:

One of the certifications that many people recommend to start out with is CompTIA's Security+.  It has a great baseline of information that any professional (cybersecurity or otherwise, should know).

Here's some free / cheap resources that can be useful:
