# Operating Systems
You've installed a virtualization software like VirtualBox - now what?

Well, now you need an operating system (OS) to run.  You're probably most familiar with Windows, but what about Linux (and all its flavors)?

Now that you have the capability to build VMs, get yourself set up with an OS!  OS installation files are commonly referred to as "images" and typically come in ".iso" file format.

You could install Windows, sure.  But you know what's more fun?  Installing something you've never used before, like Linux!

Here's a list of OS's that you can test out, and absolutely this is not an all inclusive list.  As you can see, there are MANY flavors of Linux :) - enjoy trying them all!

(If you don't know where to start, I recommend starting with Kali, Pop, or CentOS)

There are multiple articles on how to get Mac images to virtualize a MacBook - however, there isn't an "official" repository for this.  If you're interested, simply Google something like "macOS virtual image download".
