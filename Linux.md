# Linux
As a technical person, it's incredibly important to familiarize yourself with Linux.

Maybe even more importantly is getting comfortable in a terminal.  The terminal is also known as a shell.  In Windows, it's opened by Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or Powershell (powershell.exe).

If you were to ask me how to learn Linux, my answer would be two-fold.  One - start daily driving a Linux flavor like Mint; Two - practice via challenges!

By daily driving (in other words, using it as your main OS instead of Windows), you will be forced to learn how to use it.  Updates, software installation, drivers, troubleshooting, etc.

Here's a resource that you can use to help you on your Linux journey :)

### **Linux Journey**
Free, many easily digestible lessons on how to learn Linux

Secondly, people have already made challenges that you can work on to learn!  These are in CTF (Capture the Flag) style, in which you must find the "flag".

I highly recommend OverTheWire for this.  In fact, OverTheWire has many challenges - specifically to learn Linux, start with "Bandit".

Will you get stuck?  Probably.

But it's part of the fun and joy of learning!  Continue to do your research and continue learning - learn to embrace the unknown :)
