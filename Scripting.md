# Scripting
Scripting comes in different flavors.

Perhaps the main scripting languages are Powershell (Windows-native) and Bash (Linux-native).

Just like coding, no one is asking you to be an Iron Scripter.

But I can say with 100000% certainty, that knowing some scripting will make your life so much easier.
