# Virtual Machines
This is a great place to start!

Virtual Machines (VMs) offer the capability to test and learn about all the things.

Want to analyze malware?  VM
Want to test a new tool? VM
Want to host a web server? VM
Want to test code?  VM

VMs are used in enterprise environments, but there is software available for home users.  These range from free solutions to paid, but most have the same set of capabilities.

One of the most important capabilities being able to take "snapshots".  Snapshots allow you to save the state of a virtual machine and revert back to it should something go wrong.

Here's some virtualization software solutions for home users that are definitely worth checking out.
