# Getting Started in Tech
So you've made it to this repository - either I've shared this with you or someone else has shared this with you or maybe you found this via the Googles.

**Either way, I'm glad you're here!**

What is this repo?  This is designed to contain resources to begin learning technical skills.

Maybe you don't know if you want to be Blue Team or Red Team or Purple Team.  Maybe you don't know if you want to be a SOC Analyst, Incident Responder, Digital Forensicator, Penetration Tester, Vulnerability Analyst, Web App Security Tester, etc.

**That's ok!**

Here's some places where you can start learning technical skills such as coding, scripting, virtual machines, etc.

*Disclaimer: the resources I'm sharing are not my own and I'm not claiming any credit for them - simply sharing them so others can make use of them :)*
