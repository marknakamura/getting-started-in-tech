# Getting Started in Tech
So you've made it to this repository - either I've shared this with you or someone else has shared this with you or maybe you found this via the Googles.

**Either way, I'm glad you're here!**

What is this repo?  This is designed to contain resources to begin learning technical skills.

What is this repo not?  It is not a walkthrough or step-by-step instruction on how to perform every task.  The focus is to learn and develop good habits (like Googling for the answer :) ).

Maybe you don't know if you want to be Blue Team or Red Team or Purple Team.  Maybe you don't know if you want to be a SOC Analyst, Incident Responder, Digital Forensicator, Penetration Tester, Vulnerability Analyst, Web App Security Tester, etc.

**That's ok!**

Here's some places where you can start learning technical skills such as coding, scripting, virtual machines, etc.

When it comes to cost, my goal is to share resources that are free or cheap.  Learning doesn't have to be expensive!

This repo is both structured and un-structured - I mean this in the sense that when the names of the sections have numbers in them, I put them in this order because it makes the most sense to me.  Once the "numbered" sections are completed, then start looking at the non-numbered sections.  For the non-numbered sections, you can do them as it makes sense to you and as you please.

(If it was me, and I could go back in time - after I did the numbered sections, I would start with Linux > Coding > Scripting > Education)

*Disclaimer: the resources I'm sharing are not my own and I'm not claiming any credit for them - simply sharing them so others can make use of them :)*
